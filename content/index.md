_Efflorescence_: _n._ The action or process of developing and unfolding, as if coming into flower. ðŸŒ¸

The purpose of this blog is three-fold:
1. **Asynchronous conversations**. I often feel trapped in the back-and-forth of pursuing just one of many potential conversation paths, when I am curious about exploring multiple facets of the point made, question asked, or experience shared. Or worse, I hate when missing context turns conversations into explanations - sometimes changing the entire topic and losing an opportunity for deeper human connection. 
2. **I am lazy.** I sometimes find myself having the same conversation multiple times - I want to try getting to the juicy stuff quicker by sharing thoughts I've already documented. 
3. **I want to be more articulate.** 

As a byproduct, I hope to look back on this digital garden as a story of how my mind and opinions grew/changed as I did as a person. 

My goal isn't to build a "personal brand" or to get as many "readers" as possible. Instead, I want this site to help build deep, two-way connections with all kinds of people. 

If you're reading this, you probably already know me, or you know someone who knows me. If it's the latter, I'd love for us to [be friends too](mailto:omgandhi10@gmail.com?subject=Hi%20from%20the%20Efflorescence%20Blog!&body=Let's%20be%20friends.).
